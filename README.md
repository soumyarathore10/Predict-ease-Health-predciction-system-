# Predict-ease-Health-predciction-system-
The system called "Predict-ease." alerts the user to any probable health issues they might be experiencing. Based on the data or symptoms a user enters into the system, it makes a diagnosis of the user's ailment and outputs the result. Additionally, if this initiative is applied in the early stages of an illness, it can be treated before it worsens. Bootstrap (HTML), CSS, and JavaScript are used in the front-end development of our website, "Predict-ease." while PHP and JAVA are used in the back-end development. All of the user-provided data is kept in several databases.
